In Miami I taught high school students English. Most students had just arrived to the US and were at the beginner level. I enjoyed working with these students and helping them create a strong foundation to learn even more English. After, I moved to New York to attend Columbia University to fulfill the Masters in Teaching English program. While in New York I taught adult students, both intermediate and advanced students. This experience helped me become a more experienced teacher. I love using lesson plans that focus on using real world examples like books, music, movies, TV shows, and current events. I enjoy working with teenagers and adults of all learning levels. Check out my blog at mongoose-esl.com!"
