    about_me: "Hi, I'm Andrew! I was born and grew up in Sheffield, England. I have also lived in Taiwan for over a year and currently I live with my wife in the Philippines. In England I helped my family operate a construction business for a number of years before I moved overseas to teach English. I really enjoy teaching English online as it allows me to meet many interesting people and work remotely. My interests include traveling, culture, music, food, cycling, nature etc. I also love meeting new people and helping them to improve their English."

    description: "In this course I will help you prepare for the four part of the TOEFL exam, however more attention is paid to the speaking and writing parts as these are usually the most challenging for most students. Having said that, the lessons will be tailored to you individual needs. After each session, homework for the writing part of the test will be assigned. I will mark the homework and we will discuss your written work in each following session."
