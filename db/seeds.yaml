    about_me: "Hi, I'm Andrew! I was born and grew up in Sheffield, England. I have also lived in Taiwan for over a year and currently I live with my wife in the Philippines. In England I helped my family operate a construction business for a number of years before I moved overseas to teach English. I really enjoy teaching English online as it allows me to meet many interesting people and work remotely. My interests include traveling, culture, music, food, cycling, nature etc. I also love meeting new people and helping them to improve their English."
